						<li>Have you read the news lately? Even if it is highly biased, it is no joking matter that the world is a grim place to be these days. Between suicides, abuse, mass shootings, environmental meltdowns, famine, disease, and lack of education just within one of the most "advanced" countries in the world (you guessed it, the US of A), the world is begging us to turn our attention outwards to what's happening around us. Two times a year we are showered with physical gifts, many of which we don't actually need despite our personal justification. The holidays are about spending time with family, not ignoring them by focusing on how to use your new iPad that you don't need but really wanted. Consumerism has gotten out of control in the last few decades, and the holiday shopping traffic isn't ever pleasant. Let's face the honesty, reduce waste, and help others! A gift-free, 100% charity holiday season can be one of the most self-rewarding experiences you give yourself.
